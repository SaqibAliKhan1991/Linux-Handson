Networking Basics: Networking is all about devices communicating over IP addresses, ports, and protocols. The commands you listed help you test connectivity, check interfaces, and monitor network activity.

- Ping: Checks if a host is reachable and measures latency. e.g ping google.com
- curl: Fetches data from URLs. Useful to check if a web server is up. e.g curl -I https://example.com. whereas -I shows just headers (status code, server info).
- ifconfig: (deprecated on some systems) – Lists network interfaces and IPs. e.g ifconfig
- ip addr:  Modern alternative to ifconfig. Shows IP addresses assigned to interfaces. e.g ip addr show
- netstat: Shows active connections, listening ports, and routing tables. e.g netstat -tuln
- ss: More modern version of netstat. Faster and more detailed. e.g ss-tuln
Netstat ("network statistics") is a command-line tool for monitoring network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics on Windows, Linux, and Unix systems. It diagnoses network issues by displaying active TCP/UDP ports, listening services, and PID (Process ID) information to identify which applications are using specific network resources. 
Common Netstat Options and Commands:
- netstat -a: Lists all active connections and listening ports.
- netstat -n: Displays addresses and port numbers numerically, preventing slow DNS lookups.
- netstat -o: Shows the owning process ID (PID) associated with each connection (Windows).
- netstat -ano: A popular combination on Windows to list all active, numerical connections with their PIDs.
- netstat -tulpn: Frequently used on Linux to show listening TCP/UDP ports, PIDs, and service names (requires sudo).
- netstat -r: Displays the routing table.
- netstat -s: Shows statistics for each protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP). 
Key Use Cases
- Identifying Open Ports: Determine which services are listening for incoming traffic.
- Troubleshooting Connections: View the state of connections (e.g., ESTABLISHED, LISTEN, TIME_WAIT).
- Identifying Process Activity: Match a specific port to a process ID to see which application is using it, aiding in security and performance troubleshooting.
- Network Statistics: View protocol-specific data to identify potential congestion or configuration issues. 
On modern Linux systems, netstat is considered obsolete and is generally replaced by the ss command.
